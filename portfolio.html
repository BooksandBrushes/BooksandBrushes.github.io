<h2>Top Projects</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <h2>AI Comparison Project</h2>
    <p> For this project, I was assigned to evaluate ten pieces of my writing content. I chose to evaluate five pieces of artificial intelligence (AI) related academic writings and five pieces
      of non AI related academic writings. I ran the content through two different readbility analyzer applications. One of them was called AntConc and the other was Datayze. I then compared
      the readbility and quality of my AI-related academic writings v.s my non-AI related academic writings. This project helped me refine my writing style by highlighting both its strengths and 
      opportunities for growth. </p>

    <h2>Business Proposal</h2>
    <p></p> This project was for my grant and proposal writing class and required us to re-create a poor buisness proposal document.
    This project was intended to teach us the standard buisness proposal document structure. This includes an executive summary, problem statement, proposed solution, methodology, budget justification, 
    and conclusion. In revising the document, I focused on improving clarity, organization, audience awareness, and persuasive strategy. </p>

    <h2>Content Analysis of LinkedIn Profiles</h2>
    <p> In this group project, my team and I collected LinkedIn profile information equating to 50 different profiles.
       Profiles were located using keyword searches, filters, connections, and 
      suggested profiles. Those lacking a headline, summary, or sufficient detail were excluded. Profiles were downloaded 
      as PDFs, and headlines and summaries were saved as labeled text files in a shared drive. After removing four duplicate 
      profiles, two incomplete summaries, and several entries used as codebook examples, the final sample included 46 profiles.
    </p>
    <p>We found that highlighting professional achievements and personal values helps students stand out to employers. Focusing on
    practical skills in writing, editing, information design, and showing evidence of expertise in LinkedIn profiles or resumes,
    prepares students for successful careers in technical communication.
