    <p>
      Since the creation of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence AI Applications, like Gemini or Claude, different topics have been up in the air.
	  People are starting to worry for their data privacy, and what it means for the arts and content creation. As 
	  a University of North Texas (UNT) senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Professional and Technical Communications, here is what I believe people involved
	  in the "AI crisis" should really be concerned about. 
    </p>
	  First, lets establish something. We are giving AI too much credit. Fun fact, AI isn't new by many decades. Have you ever used the autocorrect feature when writing a paper? Asked a website chatbot assistant
	  how to do a task? Have you ever used Google Translate? Siri? Applied the "Spam" filter in your Iphone settings? These
	  are ALL examples of AI that have existed before ChatGPT came out. What is impressive about ChatGPT is how big the data set is.
	  
    <p>
     Mind you, the STOLEN data set that was originally for a 501(c)(3) company that has now switched over to a for-profit. However, I'm 
	 not here to talk about the moral or ethical side of AI. I'm discussing how to adapt and where the line of AI implementation should be. 
    </p>
	 The truth is: the only  real concern for your job is weather or not you are willing to adapt to the changes being made with the implementation of AI. If you do not accept
	 these changes, you will fall behind. This doesn't mean you have to like everything about AI, this just means you need to learn how to use AI ethically and utilize it's benefits correctly.
	 AI image generating and video is overall terrible and shouldn't be implemented without proper approval of the data. However, utilizing AI for inspiration isn't a bad idea. AI is great at providing frameworks for 
	 different tasks and inspiration for how certain projects can be executed. It's kind of like how artist's use pinterest for inspiration when they can't think of what to draw. 
    <p>
     At the end of the day, depending on how we handle the copywrite laws and ethical cases with AI, AI is just going to either be too much of a hassle to use or change our job positions to have more
	 oversight aspects. AI, in my oppinion, isn't a threat to jobs yet, but if you aren't on track to develpping the skills to utilize the tool to your advantage, you are already behind.
